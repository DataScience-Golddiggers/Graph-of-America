Denial of service attacks against U.S. banks in 2012–2013,9/18/2012,Also known as Operation Ababil,"The websites of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and other U.S. financial institutions suffered simultaneous outages due to a coordinated denial of service cyberattack in September 2012. Attackers flooded bank servers with junk traffic, preventing users from online banking. An Iranian group called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters initially claimed responsibility for the incident. At the time, the media reported that U.S. intelligence believed the denial of service was in response to U.S. imposed economic sanctions to counter Iran’s nuclear program. Seven Iranian individuals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were eventually indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2016 for their involvement in the incident. 

The denial of service attacks against U.S. banks is significant for two reasons. First, the size and scale of the attacks led the State Department to seek other countries’ assistance in taking down the compromised computers that were flooding the banks with junk traffic. Second, the attacks would indicate that Iran—if it was in fact using the attacks as retaliation for U.S. financial sanctions—was acting proportionally in its dispute with the United States.",Criminal charges   https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged,"Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T, HSBC",Iran (Islamic Republic of),Denial of service,Private sector,http://pastebin.com/mCHia4W5,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/technology/online-banking-attacks-were-work-of-iran-us-officials-say.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html,USA,Iran

Reports indicate that the United States pursued the Stuxnet operation as a way of degrading Iran’s nuclear weapons program without resorting to an airstrike or an attack by special operation forces.

Stuxnet was the first publicly known instance in which a cyber operation caused physical damage outside of a controlled testing environment. It demonstrated the potential effectiveness and value of a cyber weapon. Many experts and former government officials feared that the attack on Natanz would open the door to other states conducting destructive cyberattacks and Stuxnet would represent, in the words of former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, a moment when “somebody crossed the Rubicon.” However, nation-states have so far exercised restraint.",Denouncement   http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-stuxnet-idUSTRE73G0NB20110417,"Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, United States, Uzbekistan, Russia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan","Israel, United States",Sabotage,Military,http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/w32stuxnet-network-information,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11388018,"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369745,00.asp",USA,USA

Agent.btz,11/28/2008,Associated with Turla,"Agent.btz was malicious software designed to steal documents from classified and unclassified U.S. military networks in 2008. A flash drive infected with Agent.btz was reportedly inserted into a laptop at a U.S. military base in the Middle East, and from there the worm spread undetected to U.S. computers at the Department of Defense and in combat zones. Russia is suspected of being behind the incident. Once the compromise was detected, it took fourteen months to remove Agent.btz from the Pentagon’s networks and the incident triggered a departmental ban of USB drives.
